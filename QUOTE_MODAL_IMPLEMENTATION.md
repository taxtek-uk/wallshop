   - Smart Walls (with TV integration, audio systems, lighting options)
   - Smart Devices (control panels, security sensors, home automation)
   - Wall Panels (fluted, HD printing, textured options)
   - Carbon Rock Boards (acoustic, mirror, standard boards)

3. **Advanced Features**
   - React Context for state management
   - Form validation with error handling
   - Responsive design matching Wall Shop branding
   - Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management)
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Email integration via Resend API

4. **UI/UX Design**
   - Matches Wall Shop color scheme (leather, mocha, stone colors)

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Integration
The QuoteModal is already integrated into multiple pages. To use it:

```tsx
import QuoteModal from '@/components/QuoteModal';

function YourPage() {
  const [isQuoteModalOpen, setIsQuoteModalOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsQuoteModalOpen(true)}>
        Get Free Quote
      </button>
      
      <QuoteModal
        isOpen={isQuoteModalOpen}
        onClose={() => setIsQuoteModalOpen(false)}
        productCategory="smart-walls" // Optional: pre-select category
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

### API Configuration
The email API requires environment variables:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```
